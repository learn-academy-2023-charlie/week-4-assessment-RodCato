# ASSESSMENT 4: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is object-oriented programming? How is it different than functional programming?

Your answer: OOP uses objects to represent and change data. In functional programming, functions are first class objects and are used to solve problems.

Researched answer: OOP emphasizes the use and creation of objects that encapsulate data and behavior, which are instance of classes, while Functional programming emphasizes the creation and use of functions to transform or manipulate data.

2. What is the difference between a Float and an Integer in Ruby?

Your answer: Float numbers are represented by the decimal point in a number (ex 1.2 is a float number). Integers are exact number that do not have a decimal point (ex 5 is an integer).

Researched answer: In Ruby, an Integer is a whole number that can be positive, negative, or zero, while a Float is a number with a decimal point.

3. Ruby has an implicit return. What does that mean?

Your answer: Ruby assumes that the return on a block is automatic.

Researched answer: In Ruby every method has a return value that by default the last evaluated expression in the method is the return value. THis means you do not need to explicitly use the "return" keyword at the end of the method to return from a method.

4. What is a block in Ruby?

Your answer: A Ruby block is an anonymous function that is passed to a method to determine the outcome and are defined by "do" and "end", and can be wrapped in curly braces. 

Researched answer: In Ruby, a block is a piece of code that can be passed to a method and executed. Blocks are enclosed in curly braces or "do" and "end" keywords and are commonly used to encapsulate a set of instructions that can be executed within a method's context. 

5. How do you extract a value in a Ruby hash?

Your answer: Values in a hash are referenced by their unique key and are extracted using square bracket notation and the key as the argument.

Researched answer: A hash is very similar to an array but instead of the values being referenced by an index, the values are reference by their unique key. To access a single value from the hash you log the name of hash and the corresponding key in square braces []. 

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

1. RSpec: (Request Specification) is a unit test framework used to describe the behavior of objects in the Ruby programming language.

2. Test-driven development: or TDD is the process of creating a test, seeing it fail and then writing the code that will allow the test to pass.

3. PostgreSQL: is a open source object-relational database management system.

4. CRUD: An acronym that stands for Create, Read, Update, and Delete, which are the four basic functions of persistent storage in software applications.

5. HTTP: (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is an application protocol that governs the communication between web servers and clients. It defines how data is transmitted over the internet, including the format of requests and responses.
